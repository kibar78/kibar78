# Halo semua! 

I am a fresh graduate who is working in the field of android development, I have a bachelor's degree from Medan University with a major in Informatics. I continue to develop myself by attending several short courses and self-study in the field of android in order to become a reliable android developer I love to learn and have the motivation to want to be a useful figure for others. That's why I want to keep developing myself. In addition, I like to work on projects that rely on creative thinking and explore a lot.
